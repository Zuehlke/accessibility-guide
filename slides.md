# What is Accessibility

When it comes to designing and developing services or products, usually all people are considered to be the same. However, the reality is that there is a great deal of diversity. Different people need different, maybe special requirements to be able to use these services or products effectively and safely.

So the term accessibility describes how – in our context – websites, apps, tools or technologies need to be designed and developed so that all users - including people with disabilities - can use, understand and interact with them (Lawton Henry, 2022).

------

So what Accessibility aims to achieve is:

1. Provide access to all people
2. Improve overall customer experience and reach more potential users
3. Improve usability for all (Section508.gov, 2022)

# Web Content Accessibility Guidelines – WCAG

WCAG is used internationally as a guideline for web accessibility and is based on four principles:
1. Perceivable
2. Operable
3. Understandable
4. Robust

------

The WCAG guidelines are divided into three levels of compliance that can be met. Each level is progressively more difficult to meet, but means greater accessibility for users.

A
Non-fulfillment means that websites are
non-usable or only
very hard to use

AA
Websites are understandable and usable by people with or without disabilities. This level is most likely to be aimed for

AAA
Accessibility for the largest possible number of users. However, it is not possible to achieve this level for all content

# For whom is accessibility important?

Disabilities can be

visual
linguistic
physical
neurological
cognitive or
auditory.

And they can also be temporary, situational or permanent (Lawton Henry, 2022). This means that accessibility is important for everyone, because anyone can find themselves in a situation where they need assistance or need to follow certain rules.
