# What is Accessibility

When it comes to designing and developing services or products, usually all people are considered to be the same. However, the reality is that there is a great deal of diversity. Different people need different, maybe special requirements to be able to use these services or products effectively and safely.
So the term accessibility describes how – in our context – websites, apps, tools or technologies need to be designed and developed so that all users - including people with disabilities - can use, understand and interact with them (Lawton Henry, 2022).

So what Accessibility aims to achieve is:
1. Provide access to all people
2. Improve overall customer experience and reach more potential users
3. Improve usability for all (Section508.gov, 2022)

# Web Content Accessibility Guidelines – WCAG

WCAG is used internationally as a guideline for web accessibility and is based on four principles:
1. Perceivable
2. Operable
3. Understandable
4. Robust

The WCAG guidelines are divided into three levels of compliance that can be met. Each level is progressively more difficult to meet, but means greater accessibility for users:

|A |AA  | AAA|
--- | --- | ---|
|Non-fulfillment means that websites are non-usable or only very hard to use|Websites are understandable and usable by people with or without disabilities. This level is most likely to be aimed for|Accessibility for the largest possible number of users. However, it is not possible to achieve this level for all content
|

Accessibility is getting increasing attention and priority from the United Nations and the European Union. To comply to regulations, websites and apps must fullfill **Level A** and **Level AA** per WCAG
